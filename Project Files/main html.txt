        <h2>What is Transfer Learning?</h2>
        <p>Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused for a different but related task. In the context of waste management, transfer learning allows AI models trained on large datasets from other industries to quickly adapt to the specifics of waste sorting and recycling.</p>
